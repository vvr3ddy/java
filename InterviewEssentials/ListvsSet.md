Here's a tabular comparison between a `List` and a `Set` in Java:

| **Characteristic** | **List** | **Set** |
|--------------------|----------|---------|
| **Ordering** | Lists are ordered. Elements can be accessed by their index in the list. | Sets are unordered. The elements do not have an index. |
| **Duplicates** | Allows duplicate elements. The same value can appear multiple times in a list. | Does not allow duplicate elements. Each value appears only once. |
| **Implementation** | ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack | HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet |
| **Null elements** | Can contain multiple `null` elements (if the implementation supports it). | Usually allows only one `null` element (if at all). |
| **Iteration Order** | The iteration order is predictable and is the same as the insertion order. | The iteration order is not predictable for HashSet; it is sorted in ascending order for TreeSet and insertion order for LinkedHashSet. |
| **Performance** | Fast access if index is known. Additions and removals are generally O(n). | HashSet offers constant time performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains) assuming the hash function disperses elements properly. TreeSet offers log(n) time cost. |
| **Use Case** | When you need to access elements by their index or when order matters. Also, when you want to allow duplicates. | When you want to ensure uniqueness of elements and when order doesn't matter, or when you want a specific order (like sorted order in a TreeSet). |

Keep in mind that `List` and `Set` are interfaces in the Java Collections Framework, and the actual behavior will also depend on the specific implementations you choose to use (like `ArrayList` vs. `LinkedList` or `HashSet` vs. `TreeSet`).
