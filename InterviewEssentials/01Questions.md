1. **Spring Bean - Definition**: In simple terms, a Spring Bean is just like an object in Java. It's created and managed by Spring's container when you run your application. Here's how you might define a simple bean in a Spring configuration file:

   ```xml
   <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBeanClass"/>
   ```

   Or with annotations in Java:

   ```java
   @Component
   public class MyBeanClass {
       // Class contents
   }
   ```

2. **@Component, @Service, @Controller, and their usage**:
   
   - `@Component` is used to mark a Java class as a bean, like a general-purpose part of the application.
   - `@Service` is a special type of `@Component` used specifically for service-layer logic.
   - `@Controller` is used in web applications to mark a class as a web request handler.

   Here's how you might use these annotations in code:

   ```java
   @Component
   public class UtilityClass {
       // utility methods
   }

   @Service
   public class MyService {
       // business services
   }

   @Controller
   public class MyController {
       // web request handling
   }
   ```

3. **Best Optimization in Spring Boot**: 

   - Use the right configuration properties to fine-tune your application. For instance, to minimize memory consumption, you could limit the size of the connection pool:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=5
   ```

   - Monitor performance with Actuator's metrics to identify bottlenecks.

4. **Testing Framework**:

   - For unit testing, use JUnit. Here's a simple test case:

   ```java
   @Test
   public void whenCalled_returnHello() {
       MyService myService = new MyService();
       assertEquals("Hello", myService.sayHello());
   }
   ```

   - For integration testing, use Spring Boot Test. Here's a simple web layer test:

   ```java
   @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
   @WebMvcTest(MyController.class)
   public class MyControllerTest {
       
       @Autowired
       private MockMvc mockMvc;

       @Test
       public void shouldReturnDefaultMessage() throws Exception {
           this.mockMvc.perform(get("/"))
               .andExpect(status().isOk())
               .andExpect(content().string(containsString("Hello World")));
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Write Code -> and Discussion on Use Case**:
   
   - When you write code, think about what problem it's solving. For example, if you're writing a login system, the code should check usernames and passwords:

   ```java
   @Service
   public class AuthenticationService {
       public boolean login(String username, String password) {
           // Check the username and password
       }
   }
   ```
   
   - Discuss how this code would be used by someone logging into an app and why it's important to secure user accounts.

6. **Time Complexity and Space Complexity**:

   - Time complexity is like how long a recipe takes to cook based on the number of ingredients (input size). For example, a for-loop that goes through a list of items has a time complexity of O(n) because it takes longer if there are more items:

   ```java
   for(int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
       // process list item
   }
   ```

   - Space complexity is like the number of pots and pans you need for cooking. If you need an additional array to store information, the space you need grows with the size of the input list:

   ```java
   int[] tempArray = new int[list.size()];
   // Use tempArray to store some results
   ```
