A simple Java class that defines a node for a singly linked list, along with comments explaining each part of the code:

```java
/**
 * This class represents a single node in a singly linked list.
 * Each node contains a piece of data and a reference to the next node in the list.
 * 
 * @param <E> the type of element held in the linked list node
 */
public class ListNode<E> {
    // The data element stored in the node.
    private E data;

    // The reference to the next node in the list.
    private ListNode<E> next;

    /**
     * Constructs a new node with the specified data and no next node.
     *
     * @param data the data to be stored in this node
     */
    public ListNode(E data) {
        this(data, null);
    }

    /**
     * Constructs a new node with the specified data and next node.
     *
     * @param data the data to be stored in this node
     * @param next the next node in the list
     */
    public ListNode(E data, ListNode<E> next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    /**
     * Retrieves the data stored in this node.
     *
     * @return the data in this node
     */
    public E getData() {
        return data;
    }

    /**
     * Sets the data in this node.
     *
     * @param data the data to be stored in this node
     */
    public void setData(E data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    /**
     * Retrieves the next node in the list.
     *
     * @return the next node
     */
    public ListNode<E> getNext() {
        return next;
    }

    /**
     * Sets the reference to the next node in the list.
     *
     * @param next the next node to be linked
     */
    public void setNext(ListNode<E> next) {
        this.next = next;
    }
}
```

In this code:

- We define a generic `ListNode` class that can store any type of data (denoted by the type parameter `<E>`).
- Each `ListNode` has two main properties:
  - `data`: The data of the generic type `E` that the node stores.
  - `next`: A reference to the next `ListNode` in the linked list.
- We provide two constructors:
  - A constructor that takes just the data and initializes the `next` reference to `null`.
  - A constructor that takes both the data and a reference to the next `ListNode`.
- We also provide getter and setter methods for both the `data` and `next` properties, which allow us to access and modify the data and the next node reference.

This class can be used to create nodes in a singly linked list where each node points to the next node in the sequence, ending with a node that points to `null` to signify the end of the list.
